A command line calculator is a calculator that is run through a command line interface or terminal, rather than a graphical user interface. This means that the user inputs calculations as text commands, and the calculator processes the input and returns the result as text output.
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of characters (in this case, the user's input) into a sequence of tokens or meaningful units. In the context of a command line calculator, tokenization is the process of breaking down the user's input into separate numbers, operators, and other elements that the calculator can recognize and process.
For example, if the user inputs the calculation "2 + 3 * 4", the tokenization process would break this down into the following tokens:
•	"2"
•	"+"
•	"3"
•	"*"
•	"4"
Once the input has been tokenized, the calculator can then use a parsing algorithm to determine the order of operations and perform the calculation.
In summary, tokenization is a critical part of the process of parsing and calculating user input in a command line calculator. It involves breaking down the input into separate tokens that the calculator can understand and process.
